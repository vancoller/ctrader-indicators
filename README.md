Welcome!

_Here are some of the indicators we've developed or sourced from original indicators but added some enhancements._

### VC_KeltnerChannel
The deviations are already mapped on the chart up to 4 times. This makes it easy for our bots to detirmine the distance from the mean or even used for manual trading.

### VC_Supertrend
The standard Supertrend indicator that comes with CTrader does not support other timeframes. We added this ability and now this helps gauge higher timeframes to detirmine the overall trend.
